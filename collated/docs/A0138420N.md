## Introduction
Welcome talented programmers, we are glad that you are willing to be part of the team and help us in the development and improvement of GGist. To get you started, we have created this developer guide to aid new members like you to get familiar with the overall coding design of GGist and clarify your doubts if any.

In this guide, we will walk you through different components of GGist and how they interact with one another when a command is issued. To aid your understanding, component diagrams of GGist will be included to give you a clear overview of the program. We welcome you to create new commands or modify the existing ones that you think are necessary. Also, you are encouraged to use Gradle Testing to examine if the new or modified commands are working the way you intended. 

Are you ready to begin this exciting and challenging journey? Let's go!


## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This application will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given 
   in the prerequisites above)
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' configuration files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can take up to 30 minutes for the set up to complete
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-change any settings files during the importing process, you can discard those changes.
  
#### Troubleshooting project setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compilation errors after new commits are pulled from Git**
* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files pulled from Git. 
* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse:<br> 
  Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose `Gradle` -> `Refresh Gradle Project`.
  
**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import. 
* Solution: [Run tests using Gardle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries).
 

## Design


### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
>**_Figure 1_**: Architecture Diagram - explains the high-level design of the application

###An overview of each component.

**`Main`** has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/ggist/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by other components.
Two of these classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by other classes to write log messages to the application's log file.

The remaining four components of the application are:
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : Makes up the user interface of the application.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : Executes the issued commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the application in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component  defines its API in the `Logic.java`
interface, and it exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class (refer to Figure 2).<br>

```

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
>**_Figure 4_**: UI Diagram

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/ggist/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,`TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` and `Listingheader`.These UI parts inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class ,and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files which are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>

For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/ggist/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the application and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
>**_Figure 5_**: Logic Diagram

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/ggist/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command. This results in a `Command` object being executed by the `LogicManager`. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Figure 6 displays the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("edit 1 start date today")` API call.<br>
 
<img src="images/EditTaskSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>
>**_Figure 6_**: Sequence Diagram - shows interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("edit 1 start date today")` API call

### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
>**_Figure 7_**: Model Diagram

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/ggist/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the GGist data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI binds to this list
  so that the UI updates automatically when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
>**_Figure 8_**: Storage Diagram

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/ggist/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* saves `UserPref` objects in json format and reads it back.
* saves the GGist data in xml format and reads it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.ggist.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

`java.util.logging` package is used for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations. The logging levels can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See [Configuration](#configuration)). The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level. Current log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Prompt message to advise developers to continue with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the application
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g application name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`):

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`.
* To run a subset of tests, right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* To run tests using Gradle, see [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for detailed instructions.

There are two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire application by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include: 
   * _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.ggist.commons.AppUtilTest`
   * _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.ggist.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   * Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as 
     how they are connected together.<br>
     e.g. `seedu.ggist.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
The [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library allows
 GUI tests to be run in the headless mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 This means that the developer can do other things on the computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
 
#### Troubleshooting tests
 **Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**
 * Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests. 
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
 * Solution: Assertions is enabled in JUnit tests as described 
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
   Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.
  
## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 3. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, GGist depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

#### Searching tasks by keywords: `search` 

Searches and shows all tasks with details that contain the specified keyword.<br>

Format: `search KEYWORD`<br>

> * The search is not case sensitive.
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `buy milk in ntuc` will match `ntuc buy milk`
> * Partial words can be matched e.g. `parallel` will match `parallelogram` but not the other way round.

Examples: 
* `search milk`<br>
  Lists the all the tasks with names containing the word `milk` if any can be found. 
```

#### Undo : `undo`

Reverts the most recent action. Undo can be called multiple times.<br>

Format: `undo`
```
###### /UserGuide.md
``` md

#### Marking tasks as done : `done`

Marks a task on the viewed listing as done. The task marked as done will disappear from the viewed listing of undone tasks, but can be retrieved using `list done` to view all completed tasks.<br>

Format: `done INDEX...`

Examples:<br>
* `done 1`
* `search oct 1`<br>
  `done 2`
 
To mark more than one task as complete, simply type in indexes separated by a comma. <br>

Examples:<br>
* `done 1, 2, 3`

```
