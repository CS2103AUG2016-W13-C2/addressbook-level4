###An overview of interactions between components when a command is entered

Figure 2 shows how components interact with each other when the user enters the
command `add floating task`.

<img src="images\SDforAddTask.png" width="800">
>**_Figure 2_**: Sequence Diagram - shows the interaction between components when issued the command `add floating task`

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskMangerChangedEvent` when GGist data is changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

Figure 3 shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to the event (`add floating task`). This process eventually results in saving the updates to the hard disk, and updating the status bar of the UI to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.<br>

>**_Figure 3_**: EventsCentre Diagram - shows how EventsCentre reacts to the event (`add floating task`)

> Note how the event passes through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI`. This process is done without `Model` being coupled to other components. Thus, this Event-Driven approach helps us to reduce direct coupling between components.
