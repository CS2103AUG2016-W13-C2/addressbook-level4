## About GGist

Are you constantly overwhelmed by the number of things you have to do everyday? Do you have a hard time managing your time? If your answer is yes, GGist is the perfect solution for you. GGist is a one-stop, user-friendly desktop application designed to aid busy individuals like you in better managing and prioritising your everyday tasks.

Unlike most of the other task managers in the market, GGist accepts straightforward, one-liner keyboard commands that incorporate flexible natural language. This makes it extremely convenient for working professionals like you who spend most of your time near a computer and prefer typing instead of using the mouse. 

Are you ready to embrace a new style of organised living? Let's begin!
