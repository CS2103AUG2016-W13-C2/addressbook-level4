## About GGist

Are you constantly overwhelmed by the number of things you have to do everyday or do you have a really hard time managing them? If you answer is yes, GGist is the perfect solution to your daily struggle. GGist is a one-stop user friendly desktop organiser designed to aid working professionals like you to better organize and prioritise your everyday tasks.

Unlike most of the organisers in the market, GGist can be launched with a keyboard shortcut and accepts flexible natural language commands via keyboard. This makes it convenient for working professionals like you who can type fast, spend most of the time near a computer and prefer typing commands. 

Are you ready to embrace a new way of living and have your life better organized? Letâ€™s begin!
